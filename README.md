GAN MODEL FROM SCRATCH:

This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model built from scratch, following a tutorial from YouTube. The model is currently trained on 10 epochs due to time constraints, but it can be trained further to achieve better results.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks designed by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which compete against each other in a zero-sum game. The generator creates fake data samples, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake samples. Over time, the generator improves its ability to produce realistic data.

FEATURES:

Generator: Generates fake images from random noise.

Discriminator: Discriminates between real and fake images.

Training: The model is trained to improve both the generator and discriminator.

REPOSITORY CONTENTS:

GAN_Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of the GAN model, training loop, and evaluation.

README.md: Project documentation.
